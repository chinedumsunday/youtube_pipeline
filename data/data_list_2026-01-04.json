        "description": "Even in the waiting, even in the silence, even in abundance, even in the low times, God remains faithful. His promises do not expire with seasons or circumstances. They are yes and amen in Christ Jesus.\n\nThis song is a call to agreement. Come into alignment with everything God has spoken concerning you, even before the foundations of the earth. The Word of the Lord stands sure; and when we say Amen, we bring the seal of Heaven upon it.\n\nFeaturing our father in the faith,  Pastor Enoch A. Adeboye, this song carries a priestly blessing and the assurance of God\u2019s word that it is settled. Lift your hands, raise your voice, and say Amen.\nEvery promise of God concerning you will find its expression in your life. It is done. It is settled. Amen.\n\nListen to more songs here: On Dunsin Oyekan\u2019s website: https://dunsinoyekan.com/music/ \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTQ3H3UZP1Q\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJA_g-_xlCs \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnPhaKs9PoA \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6oTmngasY \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7KtVDLj_P4 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXmnp_nx0h0 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7tj6YkDbp8 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fem4tFkwUEU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-eVvKthYz8 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrdmnAn9gxk \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNs0rSDl6Ww \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX5xx9gmOcU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP1SYyKp7vU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qesfKdKxXl0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3g7_kcIpLY \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dunsinoyekan Twitter: https://twitter.com/dunsinoyekan Facebook: https://facebook.com/DunsinEagleOyekan Website: https://dunsinoyekan.com\n\n#dunsinoyekan #tabernacleofdavid #theupperroom #theoutpouring #praiseandworship #gospelmusic #worshipmusic #praisethelord #amen #glory  #thesecretplaceofthemosthigh  #generationi #christianworship  #gospelsongs #generationintimacy #worship",

We accepted the first 500 boys and 500 girls who joined in chronological order on the Minecraft server when it went live. If a player broke the rules they agreed to in any way or lied on their application about any information to try and sabotage other players, they were banned by the staff who were monitoring 24/7 after an investigation, their actions were reversed and players they killed were revived, and they were replaced with the next boy or girl in line who had tried to join the server earlier in chronological order. \n\nNew Merch - https://mrbeast.store\nJoin our discord server for your chance to compete in future Minecraft challenges!\nhttps://discord.gg/mrbeastgaming\nMusic Provided by https://www.extrememusic.com\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nfollow all of these or i will kick you\n\u2022 Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/MrBeast/\n\u2022 Twitter - https://twitter.com/MrBeast\n\u2022  Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/mrbeast\n--------------------------------------------------------------------",
